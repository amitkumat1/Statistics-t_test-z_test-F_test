# Statistics-t_test-z_test-F_test
I have given some practical use of hypothesis test, t_test, z_test and F_test in this Notebook. In this context, we will discuss mostly some topics about inferential statistics and its practical use.
## Inferential Statistics
It is used to draw various inference/insights about the data
Hypothesis Testing --> Used to test assumptions about the population from the available sample data.
### Null Hypothesis 
The ground truth/ the actual present value(H0). It lies with in 95% of probability distribution curve
### Alternate Hypothesis
The assumption(H1). It lies with in remaining 5% of probability distribution curve
#### Z test --> Test for proportion
#### t test --> Test for means
#### f test --> Test for variance
We have used the purchase case datasets. Various assumptions have been made on this datasets and different statistics techniques have been used to answer those assumptions. To undertand and manipulate the data, we have used the Pandas. We have used seaborn and Matplotlib for creating the visual content. This will help us to do further indepth analysis of this data and understand it.
